Piaget developed a stage approach to cognitive development. What are these four stages? Briefly describe the main gains in each stage; that is, in what major way is it different from the previous stage? 
Briefly define the concepts of schemas, assimilation, and accommodation, providing an example of each. How do they work together to achieve changes in thinking?
Explain the roles of disequilibrium and equilibrium in cognitive development. Provide an example to illustrate.
How does Piaget see a newborn baby? That is, what, according to Piaget, do babies come into the world with? What do they NOT have? (hint: why is the first stage called the sensorimotor stage?)
